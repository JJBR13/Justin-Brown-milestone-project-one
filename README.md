## Design 

### Colour Pallette

- This pallette was selected to completment the heavy use of images, to sofen and complement them. While staying true to the vision of the business and clients desires. 

### Typography 

[*Sourced via google fonts.*](https://fonts.google.com/) 

- Heading: used "Lobster" this is a creative, modern flowing font allowing a quirky vibe through the site. 

- Body: Used "Open Sans" commonly with light weight, this font is simple and readable allowing easy processing. 

### Images 

- Imagery was a higly important aspect within this site, as the site aim was to transport the user  into imagening themselves on adventures/ holiday in one of the vans. 

- This was achived throughout the site: 
    - Hero Section on both home and view Van pages were used to capture the attetntion of the user. 
    - The homepage incorporated the "wanderlust gallery", allowing the user to see and picture themseleves within the vans and different locations. 
    - Under each option of van provided a carousel of images sliding indefinately showing images of the specific type of van. 

## Website Constuction

 ![Flow diagram: website flow](assets/img/README/site_flow.png)

- The website consits of 3 main pages:
  - Hompage: Landing page, featuring links outbound to other pages and wanderlust gallery. 
  - View vans: Provides information on the three types of vans offered to hire. 
  - Contact: Provides contact form to allow the client to enquire or book in.

- All pages have feature buttons/ call to actions or internal links to allow easy, comprehensive navigations through the entirity of the site. Allowing for a better user experience. 

### Nav-bar 

- The Nav-bar was located through-out all pages in the same format to allow consitancy and ease provided when using the site. 
- In desktop & tablet view the nav-bar is horozontally position in list format with a button loacated on right side to contact the company. 
- The nav-bar is not "sticky" allowing for it to disapper with scroll, this was elected for the images and content of the lower blocks could utilise the entirity of the page at all times. 

- The nav-bar is responsive meaning when 325px is reached (mobile devices) the nav-bar moves into hamburger format, allowing the screen not to be conjested. Further the button style is removed and appears as other pages, do within the hamburger dropdown. 

### 404 Error Page 

- This is [.html](https://github.com/JJBR13/Justin-Brown-milestone-project-one/blob/main/404.html) file that has been created and customised to enable the userer to navigate back to the hompage if an error happens when navigating the site. 
-This features in-line CSS styling and a simple link back to the hompage. By having inline styling in there is any issue relates to stlye.css file or bootstrap documentations this page still be active and within selected style. 

### Page creation for form submission

- To allow for a better user experience, the creation of contact-submission.html & sign-up-complete.html were created. This allowed for the user to eaily see the forms had been completed and return back to the homepage decreacing website bounce rate, and continuing the session.
