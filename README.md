## Design 

### Colour Palette
 
![Colour Palette](assets/img/README/colour.png)

- The simple, fresh, natural scheme was selected. To reflect the adventures of the outdoors, with the green and blue contrasting whites and to maintain the vibe.

- This palette was selected to complete the heavy use of images, to soothe and complement them.

### Typography 

[*Sourced via google fonts.*](https://fonts.google.com/) 

- Headings: used "Lobster". This is a creative, modern, flowing font, allowing a quirky vibe through the site.

- Body: Using "Open Sans", is a screen-friendly font. This font is simple and readable, allowing easy processing. 

### Images 

- Imagery was a highly important aspect of this site, as the site's aim was to transport the user into imagining themselves on adventures or holidays in one of the vans.

- This was achieved throughout the site:
    - Having a hero section on both the home and view-van pages was used to capture the attention of the user.
    - The homepage incorporated the "wanderlust gallery," allowing the user to see and imagine themselves within the vans and different locations. 
    - Under each option of van, a carousel of images slides indefinitely, showing images of the specific type of van.

## Website Constuction 

### Webpage Layout 

 [Click here for Wireframe PDF](wireframes.pdf)

 ![Flow diagram: website flow](assets/img/README/site_flow.png)

- The website consists of 3 main pages:
  - Hompage: Landing page, featuring links outbound to other pages and a wanderlust gallery. 
  - View-Vans: provides information on the three types of vans offered for hire.
  - Contact: Provides a contact form to allow the client to enquire or book in.
  - Cancellation policy: simply a page stating the policy of cancellation. 
- All pages have feature buttons, call to actions, or internal links to allow easy, comprehensive navigation through the entirety of the site, allowing for a better user experience.


### Favicon 

The logo of the business was added to be the favicon of the site. This was to further add clarity for the user when using a browser. Using a simple bit of imagery associated with the business. This enhances the experience for user stories: 

> Being a holiday bound client, I want easy viewing, not stressful, and allowing easily contactable. 
> As a travel broker, I want an easy-to-navigate site to be able to show prospective clients the holiday services offered.

### Nav-bar 

- The nav-bar was located throughout all pages in the same format to allow consistency and ease of use when using the site.
In desktop and tablet views, the nav-bar is horizontally positioned in list format with a button located on the right side to contact the company.

- The nav-bar is not "sticky", allowing for it to disappear with scroll. This was elected so the images and content of the lower blocks could utilise the entire width of the page at all times.

- The nav-bar is responsive, meaning when 325px is reached (mobile devices), the nav-bar moves into hamburger format, allowing the screen not to be cluttered. Furthermore, the button style is removed and appears as other pages, do within the hamburger dropdown. 

- These design choices were done to implement user story: 

> As a travel broker, I want an easy-to-navigate site to be able to show prospective clients the holiday services offered.
> Being a holiday bound client, I want to be able to show my family one mobile device. 
> Being a holiday bound client, I want easy viewing, not stressful, and allowing easily contactable. 

### Home 

- The home page located three important elements: 

1. Style of vans offered and links to further information. This was important to achieve the user story:
> Being a holiday bound client, I want to see a variety and style of campervans available to hire. 

2. Reviews of past clients "What Our VanLifers Say". This was important to achieve the user story:
> Having limited holiday options, I want to see previous customer comments as a trustworthy company. 

3. The "Feel The Wanderlust Gallery". This was important to achieve the user story:
>  As a travel broker, I want an up-to-date gallery of images of the van and locations traveled to create insight and hype for 
the customer.
> Having limited holiday options, I want a taste of whether this is a holiday I want to go on. 

### View Vans 

- Provided description of the vans that can be hired, further directing the user to the contact page to be able to book desired van and dates. This was important for the user story: 

> Being a holiday bound client, I want to see a variety and style of campervans available to hire.

### Contact Page 

- This page housed the contact form which enables the user to be able to enquire about van availability, dates, and general questions. It also contained a checkbox to accept the cancelation policy. The purpose of this form was to address user stories: 

> Having limited holiday options, I want to be able to contact support easily, with concerns or questions that may need answers. 
> Being a holiday bound client, I want easy viewing, not stressful, and allowing easily contactable. 

### Footer 

- The footer was located on all main pages (index.html, view-vans.html, and contact.html), this allows consistency for the user.

- The footer also houses the social links, using font-awesome icons. Showing the entirety and scale of the business, reviews from past clients, and posts of the adventure they undertook, this was important to aid user stories: 

> Having limited holiday options, I want to see previous customer comments as a trustworthy company. 
> Having limited holiday options, I want a taste of whether this is a holiday I want to go on.
> As a travel broker, I want to be able to promote your services to prospective clients as a holiday option. 


### 404 Error Page 

- This is [.html](https://github.com/JJBR13/Justin-Brown-milestone-project-one/blob/main/404.html) file that has been created and customised to enable the user to navigate back to the homepage if an error happens when navigating the site. 

- Futher enhancing user story:
> As a travel broker, I want an easy-to-navigate site to be able to show prospective clients the holiday services offered.
> Being a holiday bound client, I want easy viewing, not stressful, and allowing easily contactable.

### Submission Pages

- To allow for a better user experience, the creation of contact-submission.html and sign-up-complete.html were created. This allowed the user to easily see that the forms had been completed and return back to the homepage, decreasing the website bounce rate and continuing the session. This helped contribute to user stories: 

> Being a holiday bound client, I want easy viewing, not stressful, and allowing easily contactable. 
> Having limited holiday options, I want to be able to contact support easily, with concerns or questions that may need answers.
> As a travel broker, I want an easy-to-navigate site to be able to show prospective clients the holiday services offered.
 
## Current Features 

### Responsive on all Devices 

- This website provides a basic online platform for a rental campervan business and has been created using a mobile-first design which is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
- The Luv4-Wheels site was created using the Bootstrap grid system, flex class, and documentation, which allows website content to look correct across all devices.

## Future Releases 

### 1) Adding more content

- This site has the ability to have more pages to attract more traffic to it. For example, a blog page or an adventure manual (for design ideas, please see the wireframe PDF).

### 2) Booking system 

- Allowing the user to book their desired van and dates without using the booking form would be a huge upgrade and user experience improvement.

### 3) App 

- By using website content and design styling (brand identity), carry this across to an app with a user database, allowing user profiles. This would create a strong sense of community.
