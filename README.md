## Design 

### Colour Palette
 
![Colour Palette](assets/img/README/colour.png)

- The simple, fresh, natural scheme was selected. To reflect the adventures of the outdoors, with the green and blue contrasting whites and to maintain the vibe.

- This palette was selected to complete the heavy use of images, to soothe and complement them.

### Typography 

[*Sourced via google fonts.*](https://fonts.google.com/) 

- Headings: used "Lobster". This is a creative, modern, flowing font, allowing a quirky vibe through the site.

- Body: Using "Open Sans", is a screen-friendly font. This font is simple and readable, allowing easy processing. 

### Images 

- Imagery was a highly important aspect of this site, as the site's aim was to transport the user into imagining themselves on adventures or holidays in one of the vans.

- This was achieved throughout the site:
    - Having a hero section on both the home and view-van pages was used to capture the attention of the user.
    - The homepage incorporated the "wanderlust gallery," allowing the user to see and imagine themselves within the vans and different locations. 
    - Under each option of van, a carousel of images slides indefinitely, showing images of the specific type of van.

## Website Constuction 

### Webpage Layout 

 [Click here for Wireframe PDF](wireframes.pdf)

 ![Flow diagram: website flow](assets/img/README/site_flow.png)

- The website consists of 3 main pages:
  - Hompage: Landing page, featuring links outbound to other pages and a wanderlust gallery. 
  - View-Vans: provides information on the three types of vans offered for hire.
  - Contact: Provides a contact form to allow the client to enquire or book in.
  - Cancellation policy: simply a page stating the policy of cancellation. 
- All pages have feature buttons, call to actions, or internal links to allow easy, comprehensive navigation through the entirety of the site, allowing for a better user experience.

### Nav-bar 

- The nav-bar was located throughout all pages in the same format to allow consistency and ease of use when using the site.
In desktop and tablet views, the nav-bar is horizontally positioned in list format with a button located on the right side to contact the company.
- The nav-bar is not "sticky", allowing for it to disappear with scroll. This was elected so the images and content of the lower blocks could utilise the entire width of the page at all times.
- The nav-bar is responsive, meaning when 325px is reached (mobile devices), the nav-bar moves into hamburger format, allowing the screen not to be cluttered. Furthermore, the button style is removed and appears as other pages, do within the hamburger dropdown. 

### 404 Error Page 

- This is [.html](https://github.com/JJBR13/Justin-Brown-milestone-project-one/blob/main/404.html) file that has been created and customised to enable the user to navigate back to the homepage if an error happens when navigating the site. -This features in-line CSS styling and a simple link back to the homepage. If there is any issue relating to the style.css file or bootstrap documentation, this page will still be active and within the selected style.

### Submission Pages

- To allow for a better user experience, the creation of contact-submission.html and sign-up-complete.html were created. This allowed the user to easily see that the forms had been completed and return back to the homepage, decreasing the website bounce rate and continuing the session.
 
## Current Features 

### Responsive on all Devices 

- This website provides a basic online platform for a rental campervan business and has been created using a mobile-first design which is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
- The Luv4-Wheels site was created using the Bootstrap grid system, flex class, and documentation, which allows website content to look correct across all devices.

## Future Releases 

### 1) Adding more content

- This site has the ability to have more pages to attract more traffic to it. For example, a blog page or an adventure manual (for design ideas, please see the wireframe PDF).

### 2) Booking system 

- Allowing the user to book their desired van and dates without using the booking form would be a huge upgrade and user experience improvement.

### 3) App 

- By using website content and design styling (brand identity), carry this across to an app with a user database, allowing user profiles. This would create a strong sense of community.
